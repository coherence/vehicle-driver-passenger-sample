# Vehicle with Driver and Passenger Sample Project

A sample project to show how to network the movement of a vehicle, and add a driver and a passenger, all in the context of "shared authority". The sample also demonstrates how to perform authority requests to the vehicle, and how to handle multiple requests firing at the same time.
